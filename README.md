# ðŸ–¹ Simple Text Editor App
## Welcome to My Text Editor Application Project !
During my training period at the Institute of Software Engineering (IJSE),
I developed a user-friendly text editor application as a Fullstack Developer trainee.
This application enables users to perform various text editing tasks, including opening
any text file on their computer, editing its content, saving changes, saving as a 
different file name, finding words, and even opening files using a drag-and-drop
feature. The primary goal of this application is to provide a simple yet efficient tool for editing
text files, enhancing user productivity and ease of use.

I undertook this project with a specific focus on honing my skills in 
Java SE file I/O operations and regular expressions. By implementing the 
file opening and saving functionality, I deepened my understanding of 
reading and writing files in Java. Furthermore, the find feature allowed
me to apply regular expressions effectively for searching and manipulating
text within the editor.

As I look forward to expanding the capabilities of this application, 
I am committed to further enhancing my skills and knowledge in the realm of text editors. I welcome any suggestions for future improvements as I strive to learn and grow through this project.

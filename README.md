# ðŸ–¹ Simple Text Editor App
## Welcome to My Text Editor Application Project !
During my training period at the Institute of Software Engineering (IJSE), I developed a user-friendly text editor application as a Fullstack Developer trainee. This application enables users to perform various text editing tasks, including opening any text file on their computer, editing its content, saving changes, saving as a different file name, finding and replacing words, and even opening files using a drag-and-drop feature. The primary goal of this application is to provide a simple yet efficient tool for editing text files, enhancing user productivity and ease of use.

I undertook this project with a specific focus on honing my skills in Java SE file I/O operations and regular expressions. By implementing the file opening and saving functionality, I deepened my understanding of reading and writing files in Java. Furthermore, the find and replace feature allowed me to apply regular expressions effectively for searching and manipulating text within the editor.

As I look forward to expanding the capabilities of this application, I am committed to further enhancing my skills and knowledge in the realm of text editors. I welcome any suggestions for future improvements as I strive to learn and grow through this project.
